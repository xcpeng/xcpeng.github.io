Introduction
======
I’m a Senior Applied Scientist at Microsoft, working on the Azure AI Vision/Search Team. My work focuses on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal large language models, and vision-language systems, where I design and deploy solutions that power enterprise-scale AI applications.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Boston University under Prof. Kate Saenko, specializing in domain adaptation and disentangled representations. My research has been published at leading conferences including CVPR, ICCV, ICML, and ICLR, and I’ve co-organized international workshops and challenges such as VisDA and TASK-CV.

Over the years, I’ve built both theoretical contributions (advancing transfer learning and representation learning) and practical systems (scalable vision services, benchmarking pipelines, and AI-powered search). My goal is to bridge cutting-edge AI research with real-world impact.

On this site, you’ll find my projects, publications, and thoughts on AI. Feel free to connect — I’m always open to collaborations and discussions.
